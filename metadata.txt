description=QGIS plugin to assess flood risk impacts in economic terms for SWAT+ scenarios.

about=FloodRiskSwatPlus is a QGIS plugin designed to assess flood risk impacts in economic terms for scenarios modeled with SWAT+, such as land management changes or climate change projections. It requires watershed layers and daily flow rate output data for multiple scenarios. The plugin includes a tool to generate a damage unit layer based on flood damage maps (currency/m²) for three to five return periods. Using this, the flood risk impact model estimates the expected annual damage (EAD) at the chosen administrative level, providing an economic assessment of the simulated scenarios. Additionally, it calculates the average percentage change in flood probabilities, offering valuable insights for flood risk management and adaptation planning.
